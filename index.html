    <h1> Welcome to Gia's Programming Portfolio</h1>
        <p> My name is Gia Bonaminio and I am a junior at the University of Rhode Island. This website is designed to showcase the programming skills that I will be learning in the CSC106 course. Throuhgout this semester, I will be learning various programming skills which will be displayed here. 
        I am excited to not only learn basic programming skills, but to be able to see the end results on a website that I personally created.</p>
