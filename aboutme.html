    <h1> About Gia Bonaminio</h1>
        <p> My name is Gia Bonamino. I am a junior standing student at the Universtiy of Rhode Island where I major in Business Management and am currently pursuing a minor in Computer Science. <br>
            I am from Cranston, Rhode Island which means I am only about 30 minutes away from home. Some of my interests/hobbies include working out, going shopping, traveling, and hanging out with family and friends.<br> When I am not doing these things, you can most likely find me at work. <br>
            On the weekends, I waitress at a bar in my home town called The Thirsty Beaver and during the week I am a certified eyelash technician. Although working two jobs in college is difficult, I enjoy making money and staying busy in my life.<br>
            After college, I would like to have a job in the Business Management field and I would also like to travel more of the world. Some places that I have already been too are; Switzerland, Italy, France, Spain, and Monaco, etc. <br>
            Traveling is one of my biggest passions and hopefully, I am able to travel more places later in life.
